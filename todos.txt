To do's:

Immediate:
Bismo Guild permissions


Short-term:
Register interactions (slash commands) that are not currently registered
Unregister interactions that are no longer needed

Buttons and select menus support


Plugins:
Queuer v2
	YT v2
	SimplePlayer

Back-end:
Sandbox plugins (their environments)
Plugin permissions (Bismo determines what plugins have access to what)
Console interface (operator can interface with Bismo directly).
Broaden commands to be implemented anywhere (Discord commands, Steam commands, Global commands, etc)
Bismo modules ? Loaded first thing, allows for core changes without changing the bismo.js file (turbo plugins)
